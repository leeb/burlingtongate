      <h2></h2>
      <p>
        The freeholder for Burlington Gate has submitted plans to Merton Council to expand the main block with an additional floor. These plans were developed without the knowledge or support of residents and use new "Permitted Development" powers to avoid appropriate scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        If allowed, the construction on top of the building would cause chaos for residents, and massive inconvenience for our neighbours.
      </p>
      <h3>Rothesay Avenue</h3>
      <p>
        There are already severe access issues on this road. These would greatly increase with the flow of heavy traffic as the development becomes a construction site.
      </p>
      <h3>Sandringham Avenue</h3>
      <p>
        Youâ€™ll be exposed to noise, dust and a loss of privacy as the top of the top of the building is rebuilt.
      </p>
      <h3>Respond Now</h3>
      <p>
        You only have until February the 7th to object to the submission. This is not a conventional planning application, and does not have the same notification requirements.
      </p>
